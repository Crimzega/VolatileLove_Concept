The following project is not meant to be either a parody or clone of Yandere Simulator, or a bash at YandereDev.
YandereDev cannot claim otherwise through any videos that might devalue the work or possibly threaten me to quit working on this project.

It is meant to be an inspiration from Yandere Simulator.
A lot of the various aspects from the aforementioned game will most likely be added, minus the excessive amount of easter eggs.
The main aspect of killing students to earn one's love interest will also be removed from gameplay in its entirety as well.

The purpose of this project is if I was the one working on Yandere Simulator.
What I mean by this statement is referring to the complete functionality of original source code in its entirety at the very least.
